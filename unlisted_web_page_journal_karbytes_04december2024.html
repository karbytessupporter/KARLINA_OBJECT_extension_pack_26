<p>During the making of the past six &#8220;micro directories&#8221; in the <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;macro directory&#8221;</a> of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com I have been gradually tapering off the generation of content pertaining to recurrent themes which I consider to be too &#8220;low quality&#8221; to be considered as &#8220;sufficiently worthy&#8221; of being showcased &#8220;prominently&#8221; within the body of public web hosted digital files named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>.</p>
<p>My goal is to totally cease generating any new karbytes content after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2024 which I consider to be of the aforementioned &#8220;low quality&#8221; variety and, instead, only generate new karbytes content which is what I genuinely consider to be &#8220;sufficiently worthy&#8221; of being showcased &#8220;prominently&#8221; within karbytes (and as an exemplary example of what karbytes ideally is comprised of and oriented towards obtaining more of: logic, mathematics, metaphysics, actual physics, computation (especially artificial intelligence), and what karbytes finds to be aesthetically pleasing and thematically relevant art forms).</p>
<p>In particular (and within the next 28 days), I plan to permanently cease generating new karbytes content which I think represents the knowledge and priorities of a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice_warrior" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;social justice warrior&#8221;</a> (and I define a &#8220;social justice warrior&#8221; as someone who is not actively engaged in solving problems in a pragmatic way and who is fixated on what it sees as serious unsolved societal problems pertaining to ecological conservation, environmental toxicity, warfare, &#8220;the patriarchy&#8221; (i.e. the systemic reinforcement of men being given preferential treatment over women and women being treated, more or less, as property of men instead of self-sovereign agents), racism, ablism, classism, animal cruelty, censorship, lawful impedance of scientific or technological progress, the &#8220;mistreatment&#8221; of incarcerated or institutionalized individuals, or any other &#8220;concern&#8221; which might not be sufficiently worthy of being mention in the mainstream news nor pragmatically addressed by government agencies, corporations, or individual persons (according to &#8220;right wing&#8221; conservative mindsets (which predominantly (if not exclusively) emphasize upholding traditional notions of family and cosmology and ways of doing business which has the least initial costs but which might be the most costly ways to do such business long-term (especially in terms of how future generations of humans fare)).</p>
<p>In summary, this note expresses my long-term effort to minimize the extent I get embroiled in interpersonal conflicts in what I have come to conclude is a world governed by a harsh rule of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_makes_right" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;might makes right&#8221;</a> (i.e. that individuals with the most &#8220;power&#8221; to inflict physical harm (especially with other people logistically supporting them having such &#8220;power&#8221;) tend to get people to do what they want the most out of all people in the respective population). I think I am grateful outnumbered by people who are relatively unintelligent, unkind, power-hungry (and hyper-controlling), impatient (especially with intellectual matters), hyper-sexual, hyper-violent, extroverted, and needy for attention and admiration from people other than themselves.</p>
<p>(I do not mean to suggest that I think most humans are &#8220;fucked up&#8221; compared to me. I think it is likely that most humans are what I would consider to be &#8220;sufficiently ethical&#8221; (i.e. decent) people. At this time I do not have an efficient and reliable way to assess humanity to the extent I can discern what the ratio is of humans I consider to be &#8220;decent&#8221; and humans I do not consider to be &#8220;decent&#8221;. Hence, I decided it is most conducive to my goals for me to continue (for an indefinitely long time period) assuming that more than 60% of humans pander to &#8220;right wing&#8221; conservative worldviews and exhibit what I consider to be &#8220;insufficiently ethical&#8221; conduct for me to regard as non-descent people).</p>
<p>Now karbytes is no longer obliged to be a &#8220;social justice warrior&#8221;. Instead, karbytes is an unabashed hedonist (with its own self-serving (yet arguably altruistic) ethical policies (despite ultimately contextualizing ethics as being entirely arbitrary and solipsistic constructs designed to help an information processing agent organize its resource expenditure in a maximally efficient way in service to its goals (e.g. survival and comfort) and karbytes is primarily focused on metaphysics, computation, logic, and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transhumanist</a> utopian idealization)).
