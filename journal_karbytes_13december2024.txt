note_2: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_13december2024/

This note (which is labeled “note_2” on this note) is a continuation of the following two notes (especially the note labeled “note_1” in this note).

note_1: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_12december2024/

note_0: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_11december2024/

According to note_2, karbytes expects that karbytes will not make any further edits to the collection of public-domain and surface-web-hosted (source-code (in the programming or scripting languages C/C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS) and multi-media (in the file formats JPG/JPEG, PNG, MP4, and PDF)) files named karbytes (according to the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/ ) between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 13_DECEMBER_2024 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2024.

During the aforementioned time period, karbytes predicts that karbytes will generate a natural number of deep-web-hosted files (or a natural number of changes to deep-web-hosted files which karbytes already generated) and will not be releasing any of such files to the public (by adding those files to the aforementioned collection of public-domain and surface-web-hosted files named karbytes) until after that time period ends (and that such deep-web-hosted files (which are later converted to surface-web-hosted files (via karbytes (during that time period))) are expected by karbytes to be hosted in a public GitHub repository whose Uniform Resource Locator is as follows after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2024: https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_27 ).

Sincerely,
karbytes
