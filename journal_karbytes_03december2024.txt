Generally speaking, I would rather commit homicide than suicide.

On a “deeper level”, I “see” everything as being part of the same all-encompassing thing. According to that “deeper level” of thinking, it could be reasoned that there is no essential difference between homicide or suicide, but each part of nature is unique (which means that none of those parts are identical (which means that none of those parts are interchangeable)). I (being a self-aware part of nature (i.e. an ego or inclusive of an ego)) prefer to be immortal, omniscient, and omnipotent (even with the power to override my own rules) but am possibly finite and my body is possibly capable of experiencing more pain and suffering than I would ever honestly want to ever endure.

I would (only) commit suicide to avoid suffering beyond what I think is worth experiencing.

I would (only) commit murder in self-defense.
