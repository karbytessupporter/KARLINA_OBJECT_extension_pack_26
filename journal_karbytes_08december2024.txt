The following content is basically obsolete at the time this journal entry is being written on 08_DECEMBER_2024 at approximately 6:30AM Pacific Standard Time. That content was written approximately six hours ago before karbytes attempted to burn files to a 25 gigabyte M_DISC using a disc drive which lacked the requisite Blu-ray compatibility. karbytes consulted ChatGPT-4o about which disc drive to use instead (which resulted in karbytes finding a compatible disc drive on Newegg). (A transcript of the aforementioned conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o is available on the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/chatgpt_karbytes_08december2024/).

To Whom It May Concern:

The (25 gigabyte) M_DISC which I burned on 08_DECEMBER_2024 exclusively contains a folder named karbytes_2024_beta (and that folder exclusively contains 117 zip files).

Each of the 117 zip files which are burned to that disc contains all the files which are in that zip file’s respective GitHub repository at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 07_DECEMBER_2024.

Note that the aforementioned file collection named karbytes_2024_beta is not the same file collection named karbytes2024_0.

(The zip files which correspond with the GitHub repositories named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_26 and KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG have the string “_07december2024” inserted into their file names in order to signify that those zip files were downloaded from their respective GitHub repositories as those GitHub repositories were configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 07_DECEMBER_2024).

karbytes(Note also that the zip file in karbytes_2024_beta named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_26-main_07december2024.zip has a larger file size than what is listed in the files in that zip file named mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_19.txt and mdisc_karbytes2024_0.txt due to the fact that I uploaded at least one image to the GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_26 after I updated the aforementioned text files in KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_26-main_07december2024.zip for the last time (and before burning that zip file (along with the other 116 zip files in the folder named karbytes_2024_beta) to the aforementioned (25 gigabytes) M_DISC)).

karbytes_2024_beta was created in order to test the read/write functionality of my LG compact disc drive with a (25 gigabyte) M_DISC inserted in that disc drive in preparation for using that disc drive to burn three (25 gigabyte) M_DISCs each with the file collection named karbytes2024_0 closer to the last day of the year 2024 (and it took approximately X minutes for me to burn karbytes_2024_beta to the aforementioned (25 gigabyte) M_DISC).

I expect to add more content to the GitHub repository named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_26 before the end of the year 2024 (and no later than 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 30_DECEMBER_2024).

After I close KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_26 to further changes, I will burn karbytes2024_0 to three (25 gigabyte) M_DISCs, read test those discs (to ensure that the files on those discs are read-able by copying the entire contents of each of those discs to my computer’s Desktop directory), and declare karbytes2024_0 to be in its finalized state forever after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 30_DECEMBER_2024. (I plan on not making any updates to karbytes between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 30_DECEMBER_2024 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2024).

Sincerely,
karbytes
