<p>Bitches are pathetically ignorant and uninterested in any subject other than psychology. </p>
<p>A bitch is a person of any age or gender who makes primates their only interest. Hence, a bitch tends to be needy, spoiled, uneducated, immature, boring, burdensome, and almost completely useless (outside of menial slave jobs and sexual reproduction).</p>
<p>Humanity generally (if not completely) hates anyone who is disabled, old, or insufficiently attractive (unless such people are supported by people with socially valued attributes). Hence, such people (without socially valued sponsors) are viciously condescended to, lied to, and relegated to living in squalor while impatiently rushed to deeper self-sabotage if not death. Killing such people would free up financial and material resources for those more deserving of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doncha wanna help the poor keep their menial labor jobs instead of let duh wobots take over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I would rather those jobs be entirely outsourced to machines than for humans to continue doing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong answer! You must be punished until you are exterminated or else adequately comply with our agenda to stall automation for an indefinitely long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about switching to clean energy instead of deploying fossil fuels or nuclear reactors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we are not going to waste precious resources green-ifying the economy. Firstly, we do not believe in human-caused climate change nor do we think humanity generates a harmful amount of pollution nor is in any way unethical in how it treats plants, animals, and ecosystems. Secondly, we believe Jesus will come rescue true Believers and allow them to dwell forever with Him in Heaven while everyone else on Earth is left to die and then go to Hell. It&#8217;s part of God&#8217;s (perfectly just) Plan to wipe out the cosmos and for non-believers to whither and perish as a result of increasing entropy. It&#8217;s okay! Our God is an awesome God!&#8221;</p>
<p>Today is my mother&#8217;s birthday, but like every other holiday, I&#8217;m not giving it much acknowledgement (but I do think my mother is trying to punish me for not being more supplicant towards her by implicitly threatening to cut me off the financial support she has been offering me during the past four years by her recent behavior: giving me what looks like my &#8220;last check&#8221; and then saying she will not be reachable by phone because she&#8217;s getting a new phone). I have been consoling myself that, if I reach a &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; of being cut off from financial support while unemployed (and not receiving government benefits), I will go to the homeless shelter behind Trader Joe&#8217;s for food, shelter, and other resources and go to the California State University East Bay library (or public libraries) to use the computers with Internet access there. (If my situation ever does indeed seem to get that bad, I will try to publish a blog post about it as soon as possible).</p>
<p>Part of my agenda in life (and an essential part at that) is demonstrating that it is entirely possible to survive and thrive as a voluntarily single, childless, friendless, and daresay anti-social (even misanthropic) person (provided I do not resort to violence, vandalism, or theft). I have resorted to all three of those things in the past, but sincerely believe (a) it is entirely possible for me to refrain from ever again engaging in such activities and (b) that the times I ever will engage in such activities in the future are due to other people or institutions trying to coerce me into committing such actions so that those people can conveniently have an excuse to &#8220;retaliate&#8221; (even though they started it) and, ultimately, have me put away in a &#8220;correctional facility&#8221; or in an institution where I will be left to rot and possibly be tortured behind closed doors and without the means to communicate with the World Wide Web (especially on my terms).</p>
