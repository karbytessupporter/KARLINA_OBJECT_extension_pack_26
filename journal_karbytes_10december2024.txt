This journal entry is basically a "note to self" (by karbytes for karbytes) as a quick reference for what to do when the .onion web page at the following darknet web address is not being loaded by the Tor browser on a client computer (and while that .onion web page is supposedly being hosted on karbytes' own server computer): http://ijnqld5dkly6cpvds37nap7n7n5f2tjc4e623b3x7dkzh563wpj6v4yd.onion/

* * *

STEP_0: Enter the following two commands into the Linux command line terminal:

sudo service tor restart

sudo service apache2 restart

STEP_1: Restart the client computer's Tor application before attempting to load the web page at the aforementioned darknet web page address again.

The significance of karbytes' hosting (and accessing) its own .onion web page is to enable karbytes to feel that it "owns" a piece of the dark web (and that particular .onion web page can be used as a template for creating and/or hosting more elaborate dark web content). karbytes enjoys interacting with (and creating and storing content within the context of) the World Wide Web at all three levels: (0) the surface web, (1) the deep web, and (2) the dark web.

(When referring to the three levels of the World Wide Web which karbytes regularly interacts with, karbytes' "ownership" of (some subset of) all dark-web-based files include the aforementioned .onion web page, karbytes' "ownership" of (some subset of) all deep-web-based files include private repositories created and owned by the GitHub user accounts whose usernames are @karlinarayberinger and @karbytessupporter, and karbytes' "ownership" of (some subset of) all surface-web-based files include all files which are classified as being part of the collection of files referred to as karbytes on the following web page: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/).
