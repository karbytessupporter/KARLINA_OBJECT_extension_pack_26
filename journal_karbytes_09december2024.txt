According to my (current) knowledge, a lack of knowledge within my (current) knowledge is what motivates most (if not all of) my (conscious (to me)) behavior.

In short, a lack of knowledge is what seems to drive my behavior (in order to fill specific gaps within my knowledge).

It could also be the case that, when one of such gaps is filled, another of such gaps (within my (current) knowledge) opens up (through forgetting (which keeps me continuously “learning”).

karbytes_0: “Do you think that everything is evenly distributed?”

karbytes_1: “Yes and no (depending on the layer of reality where multiple things simultaneously exist).”

karbytes_2: “Are you asking whether or not intelligence (or agency) is evenly distributed?”

karbytes_0: “In some sense yes. What I meant to imply by my question is that every unique phenomenal object is a piece of information and (more or less fundamentally) energy.”
